# PLP 1: Language overview and setup
**Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language**
## History
Ruby was created in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan with the aim of being the first genuine object-oriented, easy-to-use scripting programming language. Ruby was born out of Matz’s desire to come up with a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl and more object-oriented than Python.\
Ruby is used for multi purposes, namely building desktop applications, static websites, data processing services, and even automation tools. It’s also used for web servers, DevOps, and web scraping and crawling. And with Rails application framework, you can even do database-driven web applications.\
To learn Ruby, I will use 2 main sources: 
1. Ruby Programming Language - Full Course by freeCodeCamp.org
2. The Well-Grounded Rubyist by David A. Black and Joseph Leo III 
## Getting started
### Installation on Windows
First, download Ruby installer [here](https://rubyinstaller.org/) \
You can write Ruby code in any text editor you want. It can be simpe like NotePad or TextEdit or some environments built only for Ruby ([Atom](https://atom.io/)). To utilize the text editor I already installed, I will continue using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). \
If you also use VSCode, install Ruby extension to start your first Ruby program.
### "Hello World" program
Type in the code below
```
#print "Hello World" on different line
puts "Hello World"
#print "Hello World" on the same line
print "Hello World"
```
The 2 lines of code both print "Hello World". However, the difference between **put** and **print** is that while **put** prints out the word in the string and a new line afterward, **print** prints things out on the same line.\
The output is
```
Hello World
Hello World
```
### Write comments in Ruby
To write comments in Ruby, you use **#**
