#Project idea: Slack bot pomodoro tinmer by Ruby
##Ideas:
A reminder on slackbot that tracks 25 mins in length for working and 5-min break in between. \
The user will call the slack bot when they start their work. It will automatically send a message after 25-min and 5-min coresspondingly to finish an interval. The timer only stops when the user send command "stop-poromodo".
