## Project idea: Slack bot pomodoro tinmer by Ruby
## Description:
A reminder on slackbot that tracks 25 mins in length for working and 5-min break in between. \
The user will call the slack bot when they start their work on Slack. It will automatically send a message after 25-min and 5-min coresspondingly to finish an interval. The timer only stops when the user send command "stop-poromodo".
## List of commands
Help: print help \
start-pomodoro: start tracking time (25-5) \
stop-pomodoro: stop tracking time and send the report how many hours they have worked 
## App Directory
I plan to integrate Google Calendar on Slack to mark the time. Sine I am also aware that it might not the most efficient way to track time by Google Calendar, I will consider other solutions as well.
