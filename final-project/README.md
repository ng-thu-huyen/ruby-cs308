## Brief Introduction
This project is an interactive 2D ping-pong game for 2 players written in Ruby. The project is built during Programming Language course instructed by Dr. Nanette Marie Simenas, Spring 2022 at Fulbright University Vietnam with the purpose of practicing Ruby language.

- Score is updated automatically when a player misses the ball. 
- Sound is integrated so that players feel like they are playing a real ping-pong match.

- Using any Ruby compiler to open the folder. My recommendation compilers are Visual Studio Code and RubyMine
